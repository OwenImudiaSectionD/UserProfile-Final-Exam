- Profile Display: Display user profile information (name, profile picture, bio) based on props.
- Counter Component: A counter component to increment, decrement, and reset a counter value using React state.
- To-Do List: A to-do list where users can add and remove items dynamically.
- Page Routing: Navigation between Home and About pages using Next.js routing.
- API Data Fetching: Fetch and display data (titles) from a public API (https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts), with error handling.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Light grey (#F5F5F5) for a clean background.
- Secondary color: Dark grey (#333) for text and important elements.
- Accent: Teal (#008080) for interactive elements and highlights.
- Use a simple, centered layout for each component.
- Minimalistic icons for buttons and interactive elements.

## Original User Request:
can you create folders, files and codes that checks these objectives hat displays a user’s name,
profile picture, and bio. Ensure that the component uses JSX syntax and proper React
conventions for rendering these properties.
2. Include prop types to validate that the component receives the expected data types.
Submit a screenshot of the rendered component displaying a sample user profile.
SECTION 2: STATE MANAGEMENT (20%)
1. Create a counter component that increments, decrements, and resets a counter value.
Use React state to manage the counter value and add buttons for each action.
2. Implement conditional rendering in the component to show a message when the
counter value is zero. Submit the component code and a screenshot showing each
button’s effect on the counter.
SECTION 3: EVENT HANDLING AND CONDITIONAL RENDERING (20%)
1. Build a `TodoList` component that allows users to add and remove items. Implement
a text input field and an 'Add' button to add items to the list, and a 'Remove' button
next to each item to delete it from the list.
2. Use conditional rendering to show a message when there are no items in the list.
Submit the component code and screenshots of the list with items and when it is
empty.
SECTION 4: ROUTING (20%)
1. Set up basic routing in a Next.js application to navigate between a `Home` and an
`About` page.
2. Use React Router to add a navigation menu to switch between pages. Include
screenshots showing navigation between the `Home` and `About` pages, along with
the code for both pages and the router setup.
SECTION 5: APIs AND DATA FETCHING (20%)
1. Create a component that fetches data from a public API, such as
`https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts`, and displays a list of titles from the
fetched data.
2. Implement error handling for the data fetch to display an error message if the
request fails. Submit your code along with screenshots of the component with
data displayed and the error message if applicable.
